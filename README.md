## Usage

To use this app first clone the repository to your local machine. To do this, navigate to the directory where you want the project to go and use the command `git clone git@github.com:Thenlie/limble-interview.git`. 

Next you will need to install the projects npm dependencies. Since all of the required packages are already listed as dependencies in the package.json file this is an easy task. From the root directory of the project simply run the command `npm install` or `npm i`. 

### This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.5.

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

### Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
